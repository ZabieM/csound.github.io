Csound is an audio library that provides users with an extensive arrays of audio
functions. As with most libraries, it can be accessed through so-called
**front-ends** that communicate with the core library. The classic front-end is
CLI(Command Line Interface) *csound*, which is present in all desktop
installations of Csound. If you use the Csound from the command line you can
edit your Csound code with any source code editor you like.

Learning to use Csound from the command line can be a bit daunting for most
beginners. Thankfully there exists a number of integrated solutions for using
Csound in a more user-friendly graphical environment. Listed below are some of
the more popular solutions. Each of these applications are supported, developed
and promoted by members of the Csound community.

### Csound Web IDE

The [Web IDE](https://ide.csound.com) runs on most modern browsers
using the technologies of Web Audio, Web MIDI, and Web Assembly. It
allows users to run Csound on various platforms without the need of
any software installation.

[Cabbage](http://www.cabbageaudio.com/) is an IDE for developing audio plugins
and standalone software with Csound. The IDE includes a full patching
environment for testing and prototyping instruments, and provides an extensive
array of GUI widgets to help users to create unique and professional looking
audio software. It also ships with over 100 ready to use plugins. The Cabbage
installers include Csound, so there is no need for a separate Csound install.
**Cabbage Studio** goes further and transforms Cabbage into a DAW with patching
interface.

### WinXound

[WinXound](https://mnt.conts.it/winxound) is a simple but solid front-end for
Csound. Unlike the other front-ends listed here, WinXound does not embed Csound.
Therefore it will forever work with every single version of Csound from the very
first to the very last without any need to update or reinstall. You will need
to install Csound prior to use WinXound.

### Csound-x for Emacs
[Csound-x](http://www.zogotounga.net/comp/csoundx.html) is a set of editing
modes and libraries intended to compose music for Csound using the legendary
Emacs environment.

for the Emacs text-editor that ships with a REPL (read-eval-print-loop) based on 
Csound's UDP mechanism, enabling realtime interaction in development as well as in
performance. Csound-Mode can be installed from within Emacs via MELPA-stable and 
MELPA-unstable.


### csound-vim

[csound-vim](https://github.com/luisjure/csound-vim) is a plugin that turns the
powerful text editor [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) into a simple but productive
Csound development environment. It provides several functionalities for editing
Csound files (.orc, .sco, .csd, .udo), like syntax recognition and
highlighting, folding, autocompletion, on-line reference and templates, as well
as macros for compiling the .csd file and listening to the results, without
leaving the editor.
csound-vim can be combined with Steven Yi's
[csound-repl](https://github.com/kunstmusik/csound-repl) for live coding.
