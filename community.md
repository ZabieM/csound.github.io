### Mailing lists / Online forums

The main discussion forums for Csound are the user list and the developer list. To join these lists, go to these sites:

This is the main Csound user group. This group deals with all questions relating to installing, running, and using Csound. This group welcome mails from new and experienced users alike. 

* [Csound Developers](https://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A0=CSOUND-DEV) 
 
This group is used primarily for developers, but end-users are also welcome. This was once the main resource for filing bug reports and sharing development patches.
